## Adaptive Transformer

Dynamically Adjusted Base: -- The base parameter, which affects the frequencies used in positional encodings, will dynamically adjust based on the modelâ€™s performance during training. This can lead to better capture of positional information, especially if the data characteristics vary over time. done

Responsive Hyperparameter Auto-Tuning: -- The model will continuously fine-tune itself in response to the loss observed during training. This means it can potentially learn more effectively by automatically adjusting the positional encoding's influence on learning. done for base frequency - rope embeddings. done

Proactive Adjustments: -- Just like learning rate schedulers, adjusting base based on performance can help in avoiding overfitting or underfitting, and ensure the model remains effective across different training phases. done--

Combined Rotary, Orthogonally Initialized, and Givens Rotation Matrices: This component integrates rotary embeddings, an orthogonally initialized rotation matrix, and Givens rotation matrices. This robust combination provides stable and effective positional embeddings, enhancing the model's capacity to represent positional information accurately. The integration helps capture dependencies and relationships within the feature space through rotational symmetry.


### Rotation Block Output
The transformation applied to the tensor using the Combined Rotary Embedding, Givens Rotation Matrix, and Rotary Orthogonal Matrix is summarized by the following equation:

    $$
    \mathbf{x}_{\text{transformed}} = \mathbf{x} \cdot \left( \prod_{k=1}^{N} G_k \right) \cdot R
    $$

### Performance Improvements

Applying these transformations to a tensor can improve the model's performance in several ways:

1. **Rotational Symmetry**: These transformations exploit rotational symmetry in the feature space, which can help the model recognize patterns and relationships that are invariant to rotations. This is particularly useful in tasks where rotation invariance is important, such as image and signal processing, as well as natural language processing where word order may vary.

2. **Enhanced Representational Power**: By introducing rotations, the model can create more complex and nuanced feature representations. This allows the model to capture richer and more detailed information from the input data, leading to better performance on tasks like classification, regression, and generation.

3. **Dimensional Decorrelation**: Applying orthogonal transformations helps in decorrelating the dimensions of the feature space. This can reduce redundancy and improve the efficiency of the learned representations, making the model more robust and less prone to overfitting.

4. **Stable Training**: Orthogonal matrices preserve the Euclidean norm of the vectors they transform, which can help in maintaining numerical stability during training. This is beneficial for gradient-based optimization algorithms, as it prevents gradients from exploding or vanishing.

5. **Efficient Computations**: Using Givens rotations allows for efficient computation of rotations in high-dimensional spaces. This can lead to faster training times and reduced computational complexity compared to other methods of achieving similar transformations.

Overall, these transformations can help in enhancing the model's ability to learn meaningful patterns from the data, resulting in improved performance and generalization on a variety of tasks.
